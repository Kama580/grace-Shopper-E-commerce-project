# grace-Shopper-E-commerce-project
This is a mock e-commerce website, developed as part of a Fullstack Academy team project called Grace Shopper.
We built a wedding dress shopping website, which allows users to add dresses to their shopping cart, both as a guest and as a logged in user.

Developed with Node.Js, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, React, Redux.

Deployed app: https://always-and-forever.herokuapp.com/products

Our inspiration, and all of the photos, are from BHLDN website: https://www.bhldn.com/
